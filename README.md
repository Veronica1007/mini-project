<H1>Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning</H1>

<i>A Data Science project for CoderGirl using the Heart Disease UCI dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci.</i>

<b>Background</b>
In its entirity, the Cleveland database contanins 76 attributes and classifies patients based on the abasence or presence of heart disease. However, for this project, a subset of the following 14 attributes is being used:

    Age (age in years)
    Sex (0 = female; 1 = male)
    CP (chest pain type)
    TRESTBPS (resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital))
    CHOL (serum cholestoral in mg/dl)
    FPS (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (0 = false; 1 = true)
    RESTECH (resting electrocardiographic results)
    THALACH (maximum heart rate achieved)
    EXANG (exercise induced angina (0 = no; 1 = yes))
    OLDPEAK (ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest)
    SLOPE (the slope of the peak exercise ST segment)
    CA (number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy)
    THAL (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect)
    TARGET (0 = no disease; 1 = heart disease)

<b>Project</b>
This mini-project is divided into three phases:
1. Exploratory data analysis
2. Model exploration
3. Summary of findings
